This Projecct is created for:
Data Science 212 Course in Artificial Intelligence Engineering Department - Hacettepe University
By students Talha and Abdulkadir

Situation related to the project is that we made some representations on the map in our project
and we received data from a source for this, so the files need to be extracted (the library that needs to be downloaded in the project is specified).
It takes an average of 1 minute to create the mapped graph.
Important notes:
 -The project runs by downloading the datasets from the google drive link. In case the drive link is broken, you can use the csv files available in this hub.
 -The zip files in the project must be parsed to the directory where the project file is located. Important for map graphics.
 -Also make sure that the geopandas library specified in the project is downloaded.
